A Python script allows you to scan the directory structure of any folder and generates a tree-like structure of the directory. It is useful when you need to document an existing project's file structure.

Give me a ⭐ if you like it.

## 🗝️ Features

* Able to copy the directory structure to clipboard with a single click
